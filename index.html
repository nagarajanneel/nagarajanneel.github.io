						<h2>My Research Projects</h2>
					</header>
					<h3>Peculiar atmospheric signatures in high resolution spectra of red giant stars</h3>
					<p>Main-sequence stars like our Sun have detectable levels of surface lithium, up to Log ɛ (Li) ~ 3.3. 
						Red giants usually transport their surface lithium deep inside via convection and destroy it in 
						proton-proton chain nuclear reactions. As a result, red giants usually show little to no surface lithium
						in their spectra (Log ɛ (Li) < 1.5). However, 2 stars in the region around NGC 7789 were found
						to have very large levels of surface lithium abundances back
						in 1986! This is found in ~1% of red giants. This mystery was the basis of my first research project
						and first full project carried through from conception to a lead author publication.
						<br />
						<br />
						In order to solve this mystery, we decided to perform high resolution spectroscopy on
						the NGC 7789 stars using the 2.7m Harlan J Smith Telescope at McDonald and the Tull 
						Spectrograph, with R ~ 45000, which is significantly higher than was available in 1986.
						We did this as part of a larger survey of red giant stars which includes open cluster as 
						well as field giants. We were interested in the following abundances:
						<ul>
							<li>Li 6707 Å - to measure surface lithium abundances</li>
							<li>He 10830 Å - to measure ionized helium in outer atmosphere</li>
							<li>C, N, O spectral lines – to measure evolutionary state of the star</li>
							<li>General Survey of other species including Na, Mg, Al, Si, Fe (metallicity), rare-earth 
							elements, etc, to look for any potential anomalies & possible correlations with Li 6707 & 
							He 10830</li>
						</ul>
						Below is an eagle eye view of all the red giant stars in our larger sample on a plot of their 
						Lithium 6707 absorption strengths vs their He 10830 absorption strengths:
					<!-- Placeholder for figure -->
					<div style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="images/fig1.png" alt="Description of Figure 1" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
					</div>
						We quickly notice that the stars with all the strongest He 10830 absorptions are ALL rapid rotators 
						as represented by the maroon triangles. These stars could potentially have undetected binary 
						companions at close enough distances to influence the stars' atmospheric dynamics. However, we also 
						notice a collection of lithium-rich stars with RW ~ -4.3 that are mostly NOT rapid rotators, and so 
						they likely have a different cause for exhibiting the same phenomena. That cause could potentially 
						be that they recently underwent the helium flash, which would likely "churn up" the atmosphere of 
						the star. Whether this is true or not depends on the star's present evolutionary state which we 
						"try" to infer by looking at the star's location on a color magntiude diagram (CMD). Below is the 
						CMD for NGC 7789:
					<!-- Placeholder for figure -->
					<div style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="images/fig2.png" alt="Description of Figure 2" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
					</div>
						In this case, most of the stars with Lithium ~ 1.1 and appearing greenish are clearly ascending the 
						red giant branch. However there are stars like the one with Li ~ 0 and Li ~ 3.0 for which it is not 
						so clear. The star with Li ~ 3.0 could be starting to ascending the red giant branch but it could 
						also have already ascended it, undergone the helium flash, and settled down as an asymptotic giant 
						branch (AGB) star. Hence, plotting CMDs offer clues to stars' evolutionary states but often do not 
						give obvious answers. Other clues include stars' CNO abundances and particularly their C12/C13 
						ratios though even those are often clues and nothing more. 
						<br />
						For more information you can read (1) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07359.pdf" target="_blank">
						my lead author publication</a> and (2) <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac922e" 
						target="_blank">the larger survey's paper</a> lead authored by my mentor Dr. Chris Sneden.
						<br />
						Future studies will gather high resolution spectra of stars in the Kepler field and investigated for 
						Li absorptions, He 10830 line strengths, and CNO abundances. The advantage of Kepler field stars is 
						that their evolutionary states are already very well characterized, making interpretation of any 
						spectral features in these stars far easier.
					<h3>Searching for evaporating helium envelopes around the atmospheres of short period planets orbiting K dwarf stars</h3>
					<!-- Content for Title 2 -->
						The He 10830 absorption recently emerged as a new way of finding planets with evaporating atmospheres 
						from the ground. In the summer of 2022 I analyzed HPF data of 4 K-dwarf systems in search for evaporating atmospheres: 
						K2-136, K2-77, K2-100, and V 1298 Tau. The principle was that if a planet had a helium envelope surrounding
						it, then the helium envelope would also transit the host star around the time the planet transits, and the star's
						light passing through the helium envelope on its way to us would temporarily cause an increase in the strength
						of the He 10830 absorption. We searched these 4 systems for variations in the He 10830 line as well as three 
						different calcium lines. Although these 4 systems did not reveal any significant variations in the strengths of 
						these spectral lines, our results can be seen below. We plotted line strength vs orbital phase of planet 
						for 4 systems x 4 spectral lines (1 He 10830 line and 3 Calcium Lines) giving 16 plots in total.
						<a href="exoplanetresults.pptx" target="_blank">This powerpoint</a> is designed such that the first slide is a grid of 4x4 systems x lines and each cell 
						has links to two plots- a spectral plot of all the available observations of the spectral line being measured
						(which are all at different points in the planet's orbital phase) and a plot of line strength (Equivalent Width)
						vs orbital phase. In both plot types, "in" means that observation was made while the planet was in transit and 
						"out" means it was made while the planet was made out of transit. 

						To lighten things up, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf8736" target="_blank">Here</a> is a paper published
						by my mentor Dr. Zhoujian Zhang (ZJ) on a system that did in fact reveal a helium tail an impressive 50 times 
						the exoplanet's radius!
				
					<h3>PACO ASDI - a combination of angular and spectral differential imaging algorithms to improve high contrast imaging capabilities</h3>
						I took on a coding project during the Summer of 2022 to try and code a new high contrast imaging algorithm that 
						combines two different high contrast imaging techniques- angular differential imaging and spectral different imaging.
						An algorithm called PACO ADI is the version that only performs angular differential imaging and was coded by my mentor
						doctoral student Evert Nasedkin. The algorithm takes high contrast image data cubes of observations taken at varying angles so that
						the planet's position rotates relative to the central star. Thus the planet moves while the noise sources remain in place.
						The algorithm then divides the image into patches and estimates the covariance of the noise within these patches. By 
						understanding how noise is correlated across a small region, the algorithm can more effectively differentiate between noise and actual 
						astronomical signals, such as light from a faint companion. In attempting to code a more advanced version of the algorithm
						that combines both angular and spectral differential techniques, I was able to code the foundational functions at the time 
						but decided to move on as my expertise in python was limited at the time. I plan to resume working on it shortly as my subsequent 
						experiences transformed my python coding abilities and have made me ready to look at the algorithm with a fresh pair of eyes.
				
					<h3>Interior Thermal Evolution of early-formed Earthlike planets enhanced in alpha-capture elements and orbiting thick-disk stars</h3>
						Our ultimate goal is to evaluate the long-term evolution and potential habitability of the very
						first planets to have formed in our galaxy. These planets may well have been the first planets to
						develop life within our galaxy, and thus may harbor the oldest and most evolved forms of life. We
						wish to understand whether a planet can remain habitable over such long time spans (i.e. 5-12
						billion years). For context, we have seen in our own solar system how planets like Venus and even
						Mars have evolved dramatically, and are unrecognizably different from what they were a few billion
						years ago. As a result, the fact that a planet is earth-sized and within its host star's habitable
						zone is not enough to conclude that the planet must be habitable.
						<br />
						<br />
						The earliest planets to have formed in our galaxy will have different chemical compositions than 
						planets orbiting sun-like stars. In particular, these first planets predominantly orbit thick-disk 
						stars with [Fe/H] between -0.5 to -1.0 
						and with “alpha-capture” (O, Ne, Mg Si, S, Ar, Ca) elements’ abundances relative to Fe enhanced by 
						0.2 to 0.4 dex <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008DPS....40.0405C" target="_blank">Cochran et al. (2008)</a>, 
						<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A&A...543A..89A" target="_blank">Adibekyan et al. (2012)</a>. Because planetary 
						mantles are made primarily of the oxides of the alpha-capture elements, we should expect 
						significantly different interior structures for such planets. This would be manifested primarily as 
						a smaller core/mantle mass ratio, as well as different abundances of the primary long-lived 
						radiogenic elements K, Th, U which are responsible for continued long-term heating of the interior 
						and thus driving mantle convection over giga-year timescales.
						<br />
						<br />
						My first attempt to simulate the evolution of these planets was by using 
						<a href="https://github.com/Huang-CL/Magrathea" target="_blank">Magrathea</a> to generate instantaneous interior structures of model planets
						and use <a href="https://virtualplanetarylaboratory.github.io/vplanet/index.html" target="_blank">VPLanet's</a>
						Thermint and Radheat Modules to evaluate these planets' interior thermal evolution with time.
						I built a Jupyter notebook as a bridge between these two codes and enabled the parameter sweeping over different key 
						parameters like total planet mass, core/mantle mass ratio, and temperature jumps between boundary layers inside the planet.
						However, we realized that VPLanet is still in its early stages and though it is ultimately designed to simulate exoplanets,
						it still has many Earth Constants and processes hardwired into it as it was initially designed to work correctly
						for the Earth as a first test. We have started to explore other potentially useful codes and it is a work in progress but 
						it gave rise to my present interest in becoming an exogeoscientist.
						<br />

					<h3>Modelling JWST's NIRCAM spectrograph's ability to detect flux variations from exoplanetary rotation</h3>
						Exoplanets that have uneven cloud cover would technically have a slight variation in incoming flux as they rotate.
						JWST could potentially be able to detect this variation in flux from exoplanets when performing direct imaging
						observations using coronagraphy. We are simulating JWST's NIRCAM's ability to detect a 0.5% flux variation in an
						exoplanet that is about 10000x fainter than the host star in the relevant wavelength range. To do this, we first 
						used the package webbpsf to simulate coronagraphic data cubes in which the planet's flux varies in successive images
						and performed Reference Differential Imaging (RDI) using 
						<a href="https://github.com/kammerje/spaceKLIP" target="_blank">SPACEKLIP</a>, a data reduction pipeline for 
						JWST high contrast imaging. For some reason the webbpsf method was resulting in alignment issues where the angular separation
						between the primary and secondary psfs before and after RDI-subtraction did not match. We are currently attempting
						a new round of simulations using <a href="https://github.com/kammerje/spaceKLIP" target="_blank">Pancake</a>
						and will report results once they are ready.
